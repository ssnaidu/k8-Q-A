what is diff b/w k8 and docker swarm?

Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.‚Äù
Kubernetes is production ready when it is ready for live service

 Kubernetes, an application can be deployed using a combination of pods, deployments, and services (or micro-services). Whereas, in Docker Swarm, 
applications can be deployed as services (or micro-services) in a Swarm cluster. YAML files can be used to specify multi-container

K8:Complex Installation, More complex with a high learning curve,but more powerfull, supports autoscalling,
 built in monitiring,manual setup of load balancer,need for a separate CLI tool
Docker swarm:Easier intallation, More lightwight and easier to ude,but limited funcationlity, manual scalling,
 needs third party tools for monitoring, auto load balancingm Integrates docker CLI

What is tool?
A device or used to cary out a particular Function.

 Task defination:
A task definition is required to run Docker containers in Amazon ECS. Some of the parameters you can specify in a task definition include:
 The Docker image to use with each container in your task. How much CPU and memory to use with each task or each container within a task.
 Master Node:Api server, shedulers,control manager,etcd

every request give to api (autentication permisions)
etcd (all the information about the master nodes and pods)
if node avilbale contact api server after contact the sheduler launch pod and api server 
kube-controller-manager- Its maintain and controls the desire and current state.
node cont(if node down intimate apiservers monitor tools)
replation cont (desirs)
endpoints cont( if reach the pod b/w svc )
service a/c and token cont( if storage data down secutrity perposs the services)
kubelet- container runing or not
